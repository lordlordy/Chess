1. Gui should offer user choice of pawn promotion
2. Look at creating a position score for a board. This should not be a method of the board as the board should be
game agnostic. It can produce a piece score as thats merely adding the value of pieces which is something each piece provides
3. Search tree still produces some stupid moves even with deep moves. This normally shows as teh computer just giving up a piece
